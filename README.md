This is a JS implementation of the [BytePusherVM](https://esolangs.org/wiki/BytePusher)

Pretty straightforward. Seems to be hitting 60 fps quite easily on Firefox and Chrome.

## To-Do

- [x] VM implementation
- [x] Keyboard support
- [ ] Audio support
- [ ] Better page layout
- [ ] Load roms from remote URL instead of locally
